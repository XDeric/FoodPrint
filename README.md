**Getting Started**

**User Story**

One day Zack was going out for lunch but couldn't decide what to eat there were a lot of options around him from fast food restaurants to vegan options. 
Zack was an environmental friendly person, so he opened Foodprint on his IPhone and put in the food options around him. 
The app calculates which food have a lot of carbon emission for it to be produced. This help him decide food that not only benefits him but the environment too.
